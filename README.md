# PD-Camera for M5Stack

[日本語](./README-ja.md)

This project replaces the hardware part of the [PD-Camera project](https://github.com/t0mg/pd-camera) with M5Stack CoreS3 to make it work.

>PD-Camera is an unofficial, experimental accessory for [Panic Inc.](https://panic.com/)'s [Playdate](https://play.date) handheld console, which as the name hopefully suggests allows the device to record pictures as well as animated gifs, in whopping  1-bit color and QVGA (320x240) resolution. Kind of similar to the [1998 accessory for that other monochrome handheld device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera) (which has 2-bit color and fewer pixels).

## PD-Camera for M5Stack Features

- Install the companion app on Playdate and the PD-Camera for M5Stack firmware on M5Stack CoreS3. All that's left to do is connect via USB cable. It works amazingly easy!

- The M5Stack CoreS3 has a power supply and camera connected from the beginning, so no soldering or other steps are required.

- The PD-Camera for M5Stack is not available with a dedicated cover or case.

PD-Camera for M5Stack is very experimental as well. Enjoy at your own risk!

## Hardware

PD-Camera for M5Stack requires the following hardware.

- [Playdate](https://play.date)

- [M5Stack CoreS3](http://docs.m5stack.com/en/core/CoreS3)

- USB-C cable

## Companion app

The companion app that needs to be sideloaded into Playdate can be the [PD-Camera project App](https://github.com/t0mg/pd-camera-app) from the original project.

## Firmware

The latest firmware is uploaded to [M5Burner](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/download). Please use that for normal use.

## Building

This firmware is developed with [PlatformIO IDE for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=platformio.platformio-ide). Please read [PlatformIO IDE for VSCode](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/integration/ide/vscode.html) for detailed build instructions.

## Known issues

- As of v0.0.2, operation is unstable; USB communication may be interrupted, companion app and firmware may freeze or crash.

- [Known Issues](https://github.com/t0mg/pd-camera-app#known-issues) with the Companion App may be reproduced as well.

## Dependency Libraries
